Description: The Java program designed to take input grades of subjects, calculate the average, and display the overall grade is a user-friendly application that simplifies grade management for students or educational institutions. The program's main objective is to provide a seamless interface for inputting grades, computing the average, and presenting the overall grade in an easily understandable format.

Functionality Overview Input of Grades The program begins by allowing users to input grades for different subjects. This is facilitated through a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Java Swing, which ensures an interactive and visually appealing experience. The GUI includes text fields for entering the studentâ€™s name, subject names, and corresponding grades. It also includes validation checks to ensure that the entered grades are numeric and within a valid range (typically 0 to 100).

Calculation of Average Grade Once the grades are inputted, the program processes this data to calculate the average grade. This is done by summing all the grades entered for a particular student and dividing by the number of subjects. This average grade represents the overall performance of the student across all subjects.

Display of Overall Grade The calculated average grade is then used to determine the overall grade. The program converts the numerical average into a letter grade based on predefined thresholds. For example, an average of 90-100 might correspond to an 'A', 80-89 to a 'B', and so on. Additionally, the program can compute the GPA (Grade Point Average) by converting each grade to a grade point (e.g., A = 4.0) and averaging these points.

User Interface and Usability The user interface is designed to be intuitive, allowing easy navigation between input fields and result displays. Buttons are provided for actions such as adding grades, calculating averages, and displaying results. When the average grade is calculated, it is displayed along with the corresponding letter grade and GPA in a text area, ensuring that users can quickly understand the results.

conclusion: In summary, the Java program for taking input grades, calculating averages, and displaying overall grades is a practical and efficient solution for grade management. Its use of a graphical user interface enhances usability, while the robust calculation and display features ensure accurate and clear presentation of student performance data.
